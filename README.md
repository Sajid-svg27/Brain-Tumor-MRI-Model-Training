# Brain Tumor Classification Using CNN and VGG16

This project classifies brain tumor MRI images into four classes:

- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary
- No Tumor

Two models were trained and compared:

1. **Simple CNN** – achieved **accuracy: 0.9967**  
2. **VGG16 (Transfer Learning)** – achieved **accuracy: 0.9800**

The project includes:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Visualization of sample images with labels
- Training and evaluation of both models
- Accuracy comparison plot

## Dataset

The dataset is from [Kaggle: Brain Tumor MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset).  
It is divided into training and testing sets.
